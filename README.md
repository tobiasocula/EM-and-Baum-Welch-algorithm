### Expected Maximization algorithm and Baum-Welch algorithm

When reading about arbitrary optimalization and variations of the maximum-likelyhood method I stumbled accross the EM and Baum Welch algorithms, and I thought I'd experiment with them and see how they work.

In this repository I have made three small applications using these, from a very simple dice bias-parameter system to an investment portfolio implementing the Baum Welch algorithm to try to estimate market regime parameters.
